        <h1>About</h1>
        <div><p>Ahmed Ololade (ASAKE) also known as (MR MONEY) is a fast rising singer-songwriter in Nigeria. <br> Born in the 90’s and raised by Yoruba parents in Lagos Island, Nigeria. He's graduate of the <br>prestigious Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife where he holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from the <br>Department of Theatre and Performing Arts. His journey into music was purely accidental as he started <br>off as a dancer and worked with a myriad of dance companies and theatre outfits in school before trying <br>his hand in music. He frontlined a few shows in school, his Afro-Fusion style and the energy he brought <br>on stage made him the fans favorite. Asake got the industry's ears tingling in 2020, when his freestyle <br>Lady (2020) went viral, with reposts from top Nigerian influencers like Tunde Ednut, Sydneytalker, <br>NastyBlaq, Broda Shaggi and many more. Asake’s music is mostly centered around his lifestyle and his <br>name which means (Specially Chosen) and reflects in his music. <br> His first single for the year 2020 (Mr Money), has him re-emphasizing confidence in himself and being <br>true to his name. In 2020, Asake was nominated in 3 categories of the City People Music Awards, he later <br> won 2 out of the 3 nominations which includes award for the Most Popular Song of the Year. Asake also <br> featured on some top songs for the year 2020, including (Star) by Broda Shaggi’s and DJ Xclusive’s (Gegeti). <br>The remix for his 2020 hit single “Mr Money" has him collaborating with Afrobeats power house Peruzzi and Zlatan</p></div>
